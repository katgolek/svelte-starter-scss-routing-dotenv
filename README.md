# svelte project starter

This is a project starter template based on template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps.
It covers basic set up that includes scss, routing, dotenv. It's based on my personal work flow and it was created in order to improve set up flow for my SPA projects. If you find it usefull, feel free to copy the repo and use it on your own.


## Get started

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*
Install the dependencies...


```bash
git clone https://github.com/katgolek/svelte-starter-scss-routing-dotenv.git my-project
```

```bash
cd my-project
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Happy Coding :)
